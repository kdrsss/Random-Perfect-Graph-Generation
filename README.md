- perfect_graphs folder contains a text file that contains clean odd hole free generated perfect graphs.
- The format is as follows: First line of the text file is the total number of graphs in the file. Then, for each graph there exist a single line for the number of vertices of the graph and the adjacency matrix of the graph.
